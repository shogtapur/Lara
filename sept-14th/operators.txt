 
 operators in java
 
 # "+ operator"
		by using '+operator' we can add string to anythting.
		
		-> we can concate string using + operator.
		-> + operator is overridden in java to concat the two string or one string with any data type.
		-> Excuction happens left to right.
		-> operand are the value to the operator.
			ex:
				a + b  => a and b is are opearand and + is operator.
		
		-> through "+ operator" we are concatination operation on string.
		
# "unary operator"
		
   ->if any operator bringing one unit effect  in the variable that is unary operator.
   ->only for variable.
   
	Q: what is one unit?
	A: it may be incrimanting or decremining  to the variable by one unit.
			"++"  incriment unary operator and "--" decrement unary operator
		
    -> both unary can be used in two diffrent ways, 
				1) post usage : first variable then operator. ex i++
				2) pre usage  :	first operator then variable. ex ++i		
				
				
	-> post unary operation are afftecting from the next  usage. i.e first use then incriment.
			operated value shold not affect at the place of operating it should effect next usage
	-> pre unary operation are afftecting first. i.e first incriment then use.
	
	
	
	Example :
	-> post usage
		class  E
		{
			public static void main(String[] args) 
			{

			int i=0;
			int j=i++ + i;
			// 1 = 0 + 1(incrimented from previous operation)
			System.out.println(i);
			System.out.println(j);

			}
		}
 
	pre usage
	class  F
	{
		public static void main(String[] args) 
		{
			
			int i=5;
			int j=i-- + i;
			// 9 = 5 + 4(decriment from previous operation)
			System.out.println(i);
			System.out.println(j);

		}
	}
